<h1>Configuring and building</h1>

<p>
  All configuration takes place in <b>build.json</b>. You can edit this file or copy it to <b>build.custom.json</b> if you want a custom one.
</p>

<p>
  If you make any changes, issue this command to rebuild configuration files:
</p>
<pre>make config</pre>

<h1>Building OS.js</h1>

OS.js has two build directories.

<h2>dist</h1>

<p>
  This is the production build of OS.js. All files have been compiled into single files (and can be compressed) to increase loading speed. This will however make it harder to debug.
</p>

<p>
  To build simply do:
</p>
<pre>make all</pre>

<h2>dist-dev</h1>

<p>
  This is what you should use when developing or testing changes.
</p>

<p>
  You don't need to run any commands to update source files, since they are loaded directly.
</p>
