<p>
  You can use the built-in tools to add and remove custom packages
</p>

<pre class="code">

# Clone and add to list
./obt repositry clone foobar https://github.com/username/package-repository

# Or if you want to add a custom folder of packages
cp /path/to/packages src/packages/my-repo-name
./obt repositry add my-repo-name

# Clone and add to list
./obt repositry clone foobar https://github.com/username/package-repository

# Or if you want to add a custom folder of packages
cp /path/to/packages src/packages/my-repo-name
./obt repositry add my-repo-name

# Then remove with
./obt repository remove foobar

# Or delete entirely with
./obt repository delete foobar

</pre>
